HOW TO CONTRIBUTE NICELY

1. Create your own branch (YourName-dev)
2. Always commit and push to YourName-dev

3. When you have a completed change which doesn't interfere with other stuff,
   make a pull request from your branch to master with master as base.
   
   If you want someone else to check it over or something set them as a reviewer
   
BEFORE YOU BEGIN CODING:

>git checkout master
>git fetch --all
>git pull
>git checkout YourName-dev
>git merge master
>... continue coding...
